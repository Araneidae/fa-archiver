Synopsis
========
fa-spectrum [*options*] *location* *id-list*

Description
===========
Computes full spectrum analysis for the given PVs.  Runs as a Python soft IOC,
subscribes to the decimated archiver data stream, and computes detailed spectral
analysis of the FA ids listed in *id-list*.

The *location* is specified precisely as for fa-viewer_\(1).

Options
=======
-f
    Location is full path to file, default is to look in `python/conf`
    directory.

-S server
    Override server address in location file.

-I ioc_name
    Name of this IOC, used for a couple of status PVs.

-D device_name
    Device name for control PVs.

-s sample_size
    Number of decimated samples per update.  Should be power of 2, default is
    4096 or around 4s per update with default configuration.

-t target_count
    Number of updates per mean spectrum.  Can be changed via PV.

-F frequencies
    Python numpy expression evaluating to a range of frequencies.  The default
    is `arange(1,301)`, but any monotonically increasing range from 1 to a
    sensible upper bound can be specified.

Generated PVs
=============
A number of PVs are published by this IOC.

The following 2 PVs are published for administration with `$(ioc-name)` set to
the *ioc_name* parameter passed to the `-I` option:

$(ioc-name):HOSTNAME
    Host name of the machine running the IOC.

$(ioc-name):WHOAMI
    Brief description of the functionality of this IOC.

The following PVs provide overall control and are published with `$(control)`
set to the *device_name* parameter passed to the `-D` option:

$(control):TARGET
    Controls how many samples are accumulated before a cumulative spectrum
    update is generated, initialised to the parameter passed to the `-t` option.

$(control):COUNT
    Counts up to `$(control):TARGET` as samples are accumulated.

$(control):FREQ
    A waveform of the frequencies being analysed, representing the top edge of
    each frequency bin, in Hz.

$(control):PVS
    The enum strings in this PV contain the device names of the FA ids being
    processed.  This is used by the show-spectrum EDM screen.

For each FA id listed on the command line in the given *id-list* the following
PVs are generated with `$(device)` set to the corresponding device name as
looked up in the `BPM_LIST` field in the configuration file specified by
*location*, see fa-viewer_\(1).

$(device):XAMPL, $(device):YAMPL
    Power density spectrum computed for the most recent sample and binned
    according to the frequency bins defined by the `-F` option and recorded in
    the `$(control):FREQ` PV, for both X and Y axes.  The units of this waveform
    are in micrometres per sqrt(Hz), assuming FA data transmitted in nanometres.

$(device):XSUM, $(device):YSUM
    Cumulative power spectra for X and Y for the most recent sample.  Note that
    because the power density curve is normalised to the bin size and internally
    compensated for slightly varying bin size, this waveform is not an exact
    integral of the corresponding `AMPL` waveform.

$(device):XMEANAMPL, $(device):YMEANAMPL
    Mean power density spectrum accumulated over `$(control):TARGET` samples.

$(device):XMEANSUM, $(device):YMEANSUM
    Mean cumulative power spectra accumulated over `$(control):TARGET` samples.
