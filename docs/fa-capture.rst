Synopsis
========
fa-capture [-o output-file] [-C|start-time] [options] pv-list [samples]

Description
===========
Captures data from the FA archiver, either historical data from the archive, or
live data from the data stream.

The list of pvs is specified as a comma separated sequence of FA ids or ranges
of ids, where a range is written as two ids separated by a hyphen, ie:

    pv-list = id [ "-" id ] [ "," pv-list ]

For example, 1-172 specifies all arc BPMs at Diamond at the time of writing.

The number of samples to be captured must specified when reading historical data
(-b, -s or -t) unless a range of times has been specified with these options,
using `~`.  If samples is not specified with continuous capture (-C) capture
must be interrupted with ctrl-C.  The sample count can be followed by the letter
`s` to specify a capture duration in seconds.


Options
=======
If historical data is wanted one of the following must be specified:

-s start-date
    Specify start, as a date and time in ISO 8601 date time format (with
    fractional seconds allowed).  Use a trailing `Z` for UTC time.  The
    following syntax must be used here:

        *yyyy*-\ *MM*-\ *dd*\T\ *hh*:*mm*:*ss*\[.\ *us*][Z]

    where *yyyy*-\ *MM*-\ *dd* is the numerical date and *hh*:*mm*:*ss* is the
    time in hours, minutes and seconds.  The time in seconds can be followed by
    a decimal fraction to microsecond precision, and `Z` can be added to the
    end, otherwise local time on the client will be used to compute the start
    time.

-t start-time
    Specify start as a time of day today, or yesterday if `Y` added to the end,
    in format hh:mm:ss[Y], interpreted as a local time.

-b start-age
    Specify start as a time in the past as hh:mm:ss ago.

For each of these three flags a range of times separated by `~` can be specified
instead of giving a sample count.  In each of these cases the syntax and meaning
of the second time is exactly the same as the first.

Alternatively, continuous capture of live data can be specified:

-C
    Request continuous capture from live data stream

The following further options can be given:

-o output-file
    Save output to specified file, otherwise will be sent to stdout.

-f data-format
    Specify data format, can be `-fF` for full rate data (the default), `-fd`\
    [mask] for single decimated data, or `-fD`\ [mask] for double decimated
    data, where [mask] is an optional data mask, default value 15 (all fields).
    Decimated data is only available for archived data.

    The bits in the data mask correspond to decimated fields:

    :1:  mean
    :2:  min
    :4:  max
    :8:  standard deviation

    where each of these values is computed over the decimation interval

-a
    Capture all available data even if too much requested.  Otherwise
    capture fails if either the start or end time of the capture request falls
    outside the archive or in a gap in the arthive.

-R
    Save in raw format, otherwise the data is saved in matlab format.

-c
    Forbid any gaps in the captured sequence, contiguous data only.  Capture
    will fail if the data was interrupted.

-z
    When used in combination with `-c` includes checking for gaps in ID0 data.

-k
    Keep extra dimensions in matlab values

-n data-name
    Specify name of data array (default is "data")

-S server
    Specify archive server to read from.  The default name is compiled into
    fa-capture.

-p port
    Specify port to connect to on server (default is 8888).

-q
    Suppress display of progress of capture on stderr.

-Z
    Use UTC timestamps for matlab timestamps, otherwise local time is used
    including any local daylight saving offset.

-d
    Subtract the day of the first timestamp from the stored matlab timestamp
    vector.

-T
    Save "id0" communication controller timestamp information as a matlab array
    in the captured data.


Data Format
===========
If -R is specified fa-capture saves the captured data in the format retrieved
from the server, see fa-archiver_\(1) for details.  Otherwise the data is saved
in matlab format with the following fields.

:decimation:
    Decimation factor, or 1 if full data captured.

:f_s:
    Nominal sample frequency as reported by archiver at the time of
    retrieval.  Note that this is not particularly accurate and is not tied
    to the time of capture.

:ids:
    Array of requested FA ids captured in ascending numerical order.

:timestamp:
    Timestamp in matlab format of the first captured sample.

:day:
    Timestamp in matlab format of the day part of *timestamp*.  If `-d` was
    specified then *day+t* will recover the true data timestamp.

:t:
    Array of timestamps of the captured data, equal in length to the timebase
    axis of the *data* array.

:data:
    Data array.  See detailed description below.

If `-T` was specified then a further field is set:

:id0:
    Array of communication controller timestamps.  Note that this data is
    interpolated in blocks, the true timestamp information can be retrieved by
    fetching FA id 0.


Data Array
----------
The *data* array is a two, three or four dimensional array, depending on the
settings of the `-f` and `-k` options, with the following meanings:

    data(xy, [field,] [bpm-id,] timebase)

:xy:
    The xy dimension is always present with a range of 2, with *data(1,:)*
    containing X positions and *data(2,:)* containing Y positions.

:field:
    The field dimension is only present for decimated data, and is omitted if
    only one field of decimated data was captured and `-k` was not set.  This
    field ranges over the number of mask bits set in `-fD` or `-fd`.

:bpm-id:
    This dimension ranges over the list of captured FA ids, and the
    corresponding FA id can be looked up in *ids(bpm_id)*.  This dimension is
    omitted if `-k` is not set and only one FA id was requested.

:timebase:
    This ranges over the time of sample capture.
