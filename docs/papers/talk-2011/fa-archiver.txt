Miscellaneous notes on FA Archiver Talk
=======================================

Need to give two versions of this talk:

1.  To Libera Workshop.  This is a long slot (1/2 hour), everybody present knows
    about Libera, but need to explain role of communication network.

2.  To ICALEPCS.  This is a short slot (1/4 hour), more general audience.


Themes
======

* Communication network.  This is a broadcast network with synchronous updates;
  this has significant implications for the FA archiver: the data stream is a
  sequence of uniformly spaced blocks of constant size.

  Can emphasise how easy it is to add new data sources to the network.

* Technology.  FPGA with PCI express and Rocket I/O interface needed to
  interface between communcation network and FA archiver.  Archiver itself runs
  on fairly basic technology.

  One role of the archiver is to make the FA network data more accessible: only
  need one FPGA card, full data stream is then available over ethernet to entire
  accelerator network.

  A demonstration of live data would be great!

* Data Stream.  Position data at 10kHz from entire storage ring plus same stream
  decimated to 1kHz for more convenient processing.  Can use architecture
  diagram here.

* Archive and access.

* Client tools.  FA viewer and zoomer, spectrum analyser.

* Applications.  Review of archive history through zoomer, spectr


Notes
=====

Guenther suggests much less text and more diagrams.
