# This file contains definitions of structures for which the layout must be
# fixed.  This file is processed by the make-layout script to generate the
# layout list which is then checked during build.

# This file contains one definition per line, except for blank lines or lines
# starting with #, consisting of:
#   <struct> <header> <extra-headers>...
# where <struct> is the structure for which layout will be generated, <header>
# is the header file containing the definition of <struct> and <extra-headers>
# list any headers needed before <header> can be processed.

# These structures define the layout of data in the archive.  Strictly speaking
# fa_entry should also be included.
