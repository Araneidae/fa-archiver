/* Interface to central memory buffer.
 *
 * At the heart of the archiver is a large memory buffer.  This is
 * continually filled from the FA archiver device all the time that the
 * communication controller network is running, and is emptied to disk
 * quickly enough that it should never overflow.
 *
 * There are a number of complications to this simple picture.
 *
 * Firstly, we support multiple readers of the buffer.  It is possible for
 * other applications to subscribe to the FA data stream, in which case they
 * will also be updated.  If a subscriber falls behind it is simply cut off!
 *
 * Secondly, we need some mechanism to cope with gaps in the FA data stream.
 * Whenever the communication controller network stops the feed of data into
 * the buffer is interrupted.  The presence of these gaps in the stream needs
 * to be recorded as they are written to disk.
 *
 * Finally, if writing to disk underruns it would be good to handle this
 * gracefully. */
