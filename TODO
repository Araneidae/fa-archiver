 * Convert all occurrences of 'struct timespec' into internal microsecond
   timestamps where possible.
 * Experiment with SSE intrinsics, see if makes any difference to CIC speed.
 * Compute decent filters for decimation, checking timing.
 * Guard against floating point exceptions.
 * Add decimation option in compensation filter.
